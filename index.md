## The Beginning

Hello there! I'm Don Krasky, Ph.D. I've completed my doctorate in mathematics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This site will exist until I do something with it, along with my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/). This page is based on the github opyouen source Cayman theme and uses Jekyll. 

## Jupyter Notebooks Work:

So far I've got a console based TicTacToe game and a basic Blackjack game. It's silly and simple. Check it out: [Python Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DonKrasky/PythonNotebooks/HEAD)
