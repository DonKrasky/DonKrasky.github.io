## Duck Blade
11/29/2022
With the help of the great [Brad Lovell](https://www.facebook.com/brad.lovell1) I will design the worlds cheapest duck blade. The flashiest spinning black/white ever to be produced from California's Diablo Valley. It will be phone-controlled via bluetooth, powered by the finest 9V Walmart batteries money can buy, controlled by an arduino board bought from Amazon. Some lessons have been learned so far. 

Motor Control: An arduino board and a motor controller plug-in board... yea I'll get the specifics up here later... The motorshield controller is an issue as it covers the pins used for the blutooth module. It may be adventageous to just hard wire the L249D motor controller and bypass the motorshield. I'll link code here soon.

Connecting to your Iphone: An HC-05 bluetooth module is unable to communicate with an Iphone. Those peasants developing on Android can connect, but we dont care about those people. After purchasing your HM-10 low energy bluetooth chip from amazon everything can be made to work. Speaking of your impecable taste in purchasing Apple products you will now need to purchase an apple computer and pay for development tools to create a proper Iphone app. As Apple folks we're better than the rest and can afford these minor expenses. 

Stepper Motor VS Standard Motor: The stepper motor I purchased is a bit weak and will likely need an upgrade. We'll see how it goes.


## The Beginning

Hello there! I'm Don Krasky, Ph.D. Doctor of mathematics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Writer of this website in all its glory. Here's my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/).  

## Jupyter Notebooks Work:

So far I've got a console based TicTacToe game and a basic Blackjack game. It's silly and simple. Check it out: [Python Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DonKrasky/PythonNotebooks/HEAD)
