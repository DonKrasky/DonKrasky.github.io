## The Beginning

Hello there! I'm Don Krasky, Ph.D. Ive completed my doctorate in mathematics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and now I'm lookign for work. This site will serve as my public face to the world, along with my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/). I'll put a link to my thesis here eventually. This page is based on the github opyouen source Cayman theme and uses Jekyll. I've got some projects in mind that will be introduced below as I work on them. My hope is that you as the reader will enjoy them. 

## Jupyter Notebooks Work:

So far I've got a console based TicTacToe game and a basic Blackjack game. I've used Matlab in research and am now learning to use Python effectively. The aforementioned projects and more to come at this link: [Python Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DonKrasky/PythonNotebooks/HEAD)

## Educational Pages:
