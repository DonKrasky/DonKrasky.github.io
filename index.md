## The Beginning

This site will serve as my public face to the world, along with my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/). It's based on the github open source Cayman theme and uses Jekyll. I've got some projects in mind that will be introduced as I work on them. For now "Hello World!". 

## Jupyter Notebooks Work:

So far I've got a console based TicTacToe game. More to come at this link: [Python Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DonKrasky/PythonNotebooks/HEAD)

## Educational Pages:

As you may or may not know I have a Ph.D in mathematics. As such I am going to treat you insignificant idiots like the morons you are. You will get NO respect until you can do algebra problems up to two step equations in your head. Once you can do that you get the status of "dirt". You stay there until you can understand Calculus. Then you are a Cat. We can be around eachother but there is no reason to talk. Master Calculus and you are a Dog. You get pets and treats. Show me something I haven't seen or don't understand I'll treat you like a human. For now I'm just being rude and talking shit. Insulting math lessons will be here in the future.
