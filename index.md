## The Beginning

This site will serve as my public face to the world, along with my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/). That page is for professional me. This one is to be myself. The occasionally funny, sometimes mean and angry, yet remarkably average Don Krasky (Ph.D). I'll put a link to my thesis here eventually. It's my page so I'll get to it when I feel like it. This page is based on the github opyouen source Cayman theme and uses Jekyll. I've got some projects in mind that will be introduced below as I work on them. My hope is that you as the reader will enjoy them. However, I have been on the internet long enough to know you random people out there are shallow, critical, and shockingly good at providing "feedback" acionable by only the likes of Heinrich Himmler. I have no intention of listening to ANY suggestions on content for my page that are unsolicited. For now I am going to look like a elitist asshole while I build content. It's the attitude the internet was born to support.

## Jupyter Notebooks Work:

So far I've got a console based TicTacToe game. More to come at this link: [Python Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DonKrasky/PythonNotebooks/HEAD)

## Educational Pages:

As you may or may not know I have a Ph.D in Mathematics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As such I am going to treat you insignificant idiots like the morons you are. After spending 4 years as a teaching assistant I have no faith in you or your miniscule quantitative problem-solving acuity. You will get NO respect until you can do algebra problems up to two step equations in your head. Once you can do that you get the status of "dirt". You stay there under everyone's feet  until you can understand Calculus. Then you are a Cat. We can be around eachother but there is NO reason to talk about mathematics. Master Calculus and you are a Dog. You get pets and treats. Show me something I haven't seen or don't understand I'll treat you like a human. For now I'm just being rude and talking shit. Insulting but thorough and detailed math lessons will be here in the future.
