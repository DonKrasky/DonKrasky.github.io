## The Beginning

This site will serve as my public face to the world, along with my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/). That page is for professional me. This one is to be myself. The occasionally funny, sometimes mean and angry, yet remarkably average Don Krasky (Ph.D). I'll put a link to my thesis here eventually. It's my page so I'll get to it when I feel like it. This page is based on the github opyouen source Cayman theme and uses Jekyll. I've got some projects in mind that will be introduced below as I work on them. My hope is that you as the reader will enjoy them. 

## Jupyter Notebooks Work:

So far I've got a console based TicTacToe game. I'm good at Matlab, but still working on Python. More to come at this link: [Python Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DonKrasky/PythonNotebooks/HEAD)

## Educational Pages:

As you may or may not know I have a Ph.D in Mathematics from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Math lessons here, maybe?
