## The Beginning

This site will serve as my public face to the world, along with my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/don-krasky-09052185/). It's based on the github open source Cayman theme and uses Jekyll. I've got some projects in mind that will be introduced as I work on them. For now "Hello World!". 

## Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
